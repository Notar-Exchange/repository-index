# Notar Exchange Repository List

This is a list of all repositories made for the ETHBrussels Hackathon to contribute to NotarExchange. We created the Notar Exchange organization on GitHub and all repositories within it have been created in this hackathon but the submission field accepts only repository so we created this index.
